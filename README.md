# Camera-Trap-IoT-System-for-Wildlife-Monitoring
This project focuses on developing an IoT-based camera trap system using Raspberry Pi, a PIR sensor, and YOLOv8 for object detection. The system detects motion using a PIR sensor, captures images and live video, processes them for object identification, and sends alerts via Telegram when specific objects (humans or animals) are detected.
